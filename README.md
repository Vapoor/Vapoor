## Learning Philosophy
I like solving real problems even when the tools aren’t obvious at first. If a solution doesn’t exist or a project needs unfamiliar tech, I’m comfortable diving into a new language, framework, or paradigm to build it myself.  
Curiosity + delivery > staying in a comfort zone.
